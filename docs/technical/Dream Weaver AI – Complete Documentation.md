## Appendix

### Appendix A: Authentication Middleware Setup

The following code snippet handles the authentication middleware. It is now located in the appendix to keep the main documentation focused on the overall architecture and business strategy.

```markdown
import { withAuth } from "next-auth/middleware" 
export default withAuth({   
  pages: {     
    signIn: "/login", 
  }, 
}) 
export const config = {   
  matcher: ["/dashboard/:path*", "/coach/:path*", "/goals/:path*", "/profile/:path*"], 
}
